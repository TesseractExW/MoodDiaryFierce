            MoodDiary is an IS school project for computer innovations class made by Grade 11 students from Bunyawat
            Witthayalai School in Thailand. We made it to solve the current situations for decreasing self emotion
            understanding.
            We hope this application can help people understand themself more. Thank you for professors, all the support
